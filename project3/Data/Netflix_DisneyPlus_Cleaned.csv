"Hello everyone, 8 years ago we woke up one day and found one of our youtube videos had gone crazy on r/Videos. 8 year later thanks to lots of support form the reddit community we got our shot at our own TV show, Aunty Donna's Big Ol' House of Fun on Netflix.

I have many email accounts. Some are spam account, others are for business, others are just for specific purposes. While I do have a netflix account, it's on a very specific email address and as far as I know i've never put my other email accounts into any netflix profile or anything, ESPECIALLY my work email, which is on the company domain.

So a couple weeks ago when I got an email in my company email saying ""Thanks for setting up your netflix account!"" I dismissed it as phishing. Didn't even open it. Today I got another on one of my personal email accounts. This time I looked deeper into it. It's not Phishing. It actually comes from the [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) domain, all the links in the email ACTUALLY link to [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) pages, and even the unsubscribe and ""contact us"" links go to actual [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) pages.

So I went back into the company email spam folder, checked it. It's a legit email too. Everything in the email comes from and goes to [netflix.com](https://netflix.com) pages.

Should I be contacting netflix and making sure there aren't netflix accounts being set up with my personal and work email accounts? My best bet is that some affiliate is setting up ""free 1 month trial"" accounts without authorization and getting a kickback for it.

Stranger Things (if you want to make a dark story, then dont do it with kids as the heroes. if you do that, then at least make their characters extremely strong-headed and mature. normally, movies with stereotypical ""unpopular kids"" as main characters are happy or comedy so its fine doing that but not in a show that you intend to make a dark one. also, why must you throw in romance in a show with kids as the main characters.)

Breaking Bad (the premise and everything is great. the story is great. its just way too stretched out. i havent seen it fully as it stretched the story of a dying person to 4 seasons and ended with him dying not even by cancer which was the start of the whole thing. this is better than the rest but too stretched out.)

Money Heist (entire season passed and they are still in the same bank)

I did actually like the movie and thought a lot of things were well done but while some aspects were impressive the same old tired stereotypes and one dimensional characters left a bad taste in my mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Asian best friend who has strict parents, her mum doesn't speak English and then there was the line about how you couldn't understand what her mum had to do to get to America.

Am sure that is still true for some but this feels like a racial stereotype in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

2) The white privilege personified in the arch-villain jock.

American teen movies love the nerds and jocks as much as they love the doe-eyed cheerleaders but it would have been better to see more than just a one dimensional trope for this guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) His black sidekick/best friend.

Talk about one dimensional, this character was only used for animalistic over the top gestures or expressions. Think of an unloveable Donkey from Shrek but with zero dialogue and added sexual predator vibes.

"Hi all,

I've been trying to log into my mum's netflix account after she changed the account details recently (the password, email address and billing account), but get ""incorrect password"" every time, even though I'm 100% sure I'm typing in the exact password she set like a day ago (she sent me the password, which worked for her, over text to copy and paste). It doesn't work on any of my devices but does on all of my mum's and my sisters'. (They live in another city than me, so that might be affecting things)

I'm trying to use it on two mac computers (PC and laptop) with google chrome and an iPhone, none of which are working

ETA: just to be clear, this password works on every other device, can confirm it worked as of 15 minutes ago for my mum's computer, still doesn't work on mine. There's no chance of the password being mispelled on my end because I'm copy and pasting what my mum has typed directly into my box, and she did the same on her end and it worked (my sister also tried copy and pasting off the same text and it worked for her.)

She asks to rewatch it but it takes some back and forth getting one of the episodes to play and once it ends it goes straight to adds because it thinks the whole series is over. Even when before something that was previously watched through could just be rewatched again. I don’t know how to get it back to doing the auto play through something that was previously watched anymore without thinking the series is over and kicking out to adds for something new instead.

"So i just watched red dot and i thought it was a solid movie. Acting is good, not amazing though. The whole vibe is nice, scenery looks great and it can get tense and scare you with its gunshots. The couple act normally at best, sometimes they do end up doing weird things but mainly because theyre afraid of dying. The first 20 minutes of the movie make it seem like its a basic revenge movie but you have that feeling that the ""poeple"" wouldnt just kill the couple for scratching their car. When the red dot glides over them to scare them you already know they are gonna torture them. Right at the begining you see the ending but it honestly doesnt destroy the vibe too much as it does give a little hope but its not the best choice, although it is because you already know everythings gonna go downwards. The twist is great, everything adds up and you realise its not just because of a couple keying a car. The emotions of thomas are well shown and actually realistic, thomas has been waiting so long just to get revenge as that kid was everything to him. True, its irresponsible that he flew a drone so far away but at least its better than just saying that there was no drone, it shows the importance of the kid to the father. In the end, he doesnt kill him so he feels the pain and its great it doesnt show what happens next, because really nothing would happen. Its only an hour and 20 minutes which is great because it doesnt stretch things for too long and keeps the action on. The ending in the house does lead to some stupid actions, for example not killing the father. It isnt that big of a letdown, but i dont see the ending any better with the father dead. I watched this with polish dubbing, i heard the english dub sucks. Overall, its a good movie and i dont understand the hate for it. A solid 7.8/10 from me.

"I suppose I shouldn't expect anything less from a Netflix series - but talk about a completely one-sided narrative that relies on wishful speculation.

It was evident from the get go this was going to be a series that was designed to pique your curiosity and spin a narrative that would engage more viewers which I can understand, but it doesn't make it any less appalling.

I think there are some people who would agree there is a simple explanation for what happened to her, but the amateur ""sleuths"" and ""internet detectives"" have forever dragged this poor girls' name through the mud, stained her reputation and the worst part is that Netflix gave them a platform to do so.

The interviewee crew all lack any sort of credibility on providing an expert opinion - we have countless YouTubers perspectives who are trying to perpetuate an alternative theory that will drive up their view counts, an internet dork who cries and obsesses over Elisa like he knows her personally and has suffered a huge loss - it just undermines what her poor family is going through and now this series will ensure they never move on from this endless tirade of shitty conspiracy theories.

The LAPD releasing that elevator footage is one of the worst mistakes they could've made in this case.

The entire reason being is that the footage is super ambiguous. When you rely on the same perspective to determine what she was doing in that elevator and how she was behaving, you unknowingly have just set a dangerous precedent for anyone who watches that footage.

There is a great theory that Elisa was playfully clicking all of the elevator buttons whilst on the 14th floor (perhaps after having a casual look around) and out of curiosity, slid her finger across a row of levels in the centre column and hit the door hold button.

She could've been confused, possibly a little flustered because she's on the 14th floor and the doors aren't closing. It has a reputation for being dodgy as the floors go up and maybe that's why she's hiding in the corner of the elevator.

She is also a vulnerable, depressed, bipolar woman who is hours away from her immediate support network and that might have exacerbated her condition.

There is a whole spiel that could paint a picture of her journey but we won't go into that.

Instead, the consensus focuses on her experimenting with recreational drugs, scared of someone/someone is with her in the lobby of the elevator, she was put in that tank by an unknown source, the LAPD is hiding the toxicology report because they are involved, a hotel worker is involved and might've coerced her to the roof, it's haunted and she was possessed to commit suicide, +100 more baseless theories.

Not to mention that a death metal musician, who yes, admittedly, posted some creepy shit, was being implicated as a ""murderer"" because of loosely-strung lyrics and music clips. He ultimately also tried to kill himself and was checked into a psychiatric hospital as a result.

I'm just disappointed that the last thing this case needed was another over-saturated, one-sided series that poses no credible sources or multiple points of view and Netflix gave this case a world-wide platform to do just that.

All this series did was ensure that Elisa's family will never be able to move on from this.

The story, plot and characters are perfectly lined up. Definitely the life shown in Wellsbury is way more exaggerated. Though, Georgia had a dark past, but I really liked her character and how she strives to provide good life to her children. Ginny's character is like every other Teenager. Austin is a silent character but he looks so cute in specs. And Ellen definitely reminded me of Jocelyn's character. It has used some old jokes but surely a complete entertainment.

(Spoilers Below)

Edit: I don't know why but my numbering isn't working properly while using RIF on my android. But consider them as 1, 2, and 3.



The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel is flawed. It's far too long, repetitive, and the production overall is not that great. 

However, I would like to address the point of the series because imo it seems to have been misunderstood by many viewers on here. I'll start with this:

1. The series isn't actually about the Elisa Lam case.

While the series involves the case, it uses it as a vehicle to tell a different story of internet investigators. It is a cautionary tale and it is absolutely crucial that the internet sleuths got the screen time that they did. Many people might say that it's disgusting or repulsive or whatever that they were given this much attention. You can decide that yourself, but the attention was negative imo. Throughout the series they are clearly mocked, though in the beginning it appears as though they might be onto something which leads me to my next point...

2. Information is withheld from the viewer (us) on purpose and the reason for this would be lost if it followed the more traditional documentary style of telling all the facts in order.

Many people were angry that the info about the water tank lid being open wasn't completely addressed near the beginning when it was first discussed. While I, and many others, thought it was silly since the maintenance worker clearly had to have opened it at the least himself, it was good that they didn't tell us this one bit of info. This allowed for the conspiracy theorists to present multiple arguments that strayed further and further away from the case. Many saw this as straying further and further from the point of the series, but like I said before the case isn't the point of the series. By doing this it allowed the viewer to become more and more confused, possibly choose a theory that sounds plausible to them, or simply deny it all and agree with the facts provided from the police. This allowed for a recreation of the feeling when the case was still active where you are overwhelmed with information, like one of the officers explained. Being overwhelmed with so much information makes a fairly simple case like this seem much larger. It allows the viewer to become like the conspiracy theorists or deny it, but either way it produces anger. This anger is necessary which leads me to my final point...

3. You should feel angry at the end of the series. This is a true crime series where the viewer becomes an accomplice to the true criminals, the internet sleuths.

This is the most interesting part for me and is what makes me the most sad because it seems like many people aren't understanding it. I will reiterate that the series is deeply flawed but this aspect was done very well. But what I mean by this is that the internet sleuths make the viewers either question the case and become angry or make the viewer angry at them for spouting conspiracy nonsense. However, at the end of the series when all is revealed it becomes clear that the entire time these internet sleuths that claimed to be the good guys were actually the antagonists of the story. They are the true villains. Their screen time is to show you how deeply concerning it is to have people latch onto cases like this to hinder the investigation at best and ruin lives at the worst. While some regret their decisions, notice how none of them ever mention Morbid or say how their actions had severe consequences. They don't take responsibility for their actions and their obsession is destructive in a very criminal way. One of the sleuths even talks about how he visited Lam's grave for closure. Clearly this person is not healthy even after everything they believed is proved wrong. They are in denial because they don't want to be the bad guy. They don't want to accept the truth or that their actions have consequences. This is what made me furious and I hope it made you furious as well because this is a never ending tale. This is just one example of how destructive people can be online when they are arrogant enough to think they know more about a case than the professionals investigating it. The video of the one youtuber saying ""I have reviewed this case for hours and I completely disagree with the coroner"" is a perfect example of how delusional an average person can become when they get sucked into a web of lies. It's also an example of how these sleuths are being mocked because they clearly are part of the problem. While the sleuths might have thought they had screen time for their ""research"", in actuality they had screen time so we can see first hand how someone that does this thinks and acts.

Conclusion:
This series is not traditional true crime. It's a stretch to even call it true crime. But it is very clever in disguising itself as true crime to get it's point across.

Yes it has a lot of issues, it drags often, it's repetitive, it has poorly done production in parts but it is not irresponsible like many have said. If anything, it's more responsible than most true crime series out right now. It's not glorifying the case, it is demonizing those that distorted it for internet clout or other personal satisfaction. You're allowed to still dislike it though, this doesn't make it a good documentary but I felt it deserved a fair defense for what it's goal was. Personally, I don't even know that I would recommend this series unless someone is already interested because it does drag a lot.

 New K-Dramas on Netflix in March 2021 [USA],new k drama march usa,0
"I'm &gt;!wondering why Mark Hofmann did not get the death penalty. He destroyed so many lives and never expressed remorse. The final episode cites hi m as saying that he feels no remorse for his victims, who were literally blown apart (their blood literally drenched the Salt Lake City crime scenes).!&lt;

&gt;!To see him smiling and even grinning in the closing credits updating his \[sic\] life was revolting. I remember the firing squad execution that led to Norman Mailer's ""The Executioner's Song.""!&lt;

The documentary was repetitive and tedious in the third episode specifically because it praised his ""genius"" rather than explained the legal maneuvers that won him life in prison rather than execution. If anyone deserved to be removed from the planet, it was this animal. Apologies--many, many apologies--if any of his children or heartbreaking ex-wife should by chance read this post, but I was stunned that the BBC, usually a first-rate source for documentaries, dropped the ball big-time on this one.

Another thing that would have been interesting is some discourse on why bombings flourished in the 80's and early 90's. Bombings seemed the serial killer modus operandi of choice in that era. (Unabomber, World Trade Center 1993, etc.)

If Netflix allowed ratings, I'd give this one a 5 out of 10. The poor man who passed the lie detector test with a twelve--only to be outdone by Hofmann himself, who passed with a 14--plus the bomb-making mania reminded me of Brody in ""Homeland.""

"Hello everyone,

(tl;dr at end)

after watching ""The Punisher""s Season 2 a week ago with Frank's young companion called Madani and now ""Polar"" with another young girl at the side of a retired contract killer I'm kinda curious if there's other movies/series with ""bad guys"", who are more cold hearted like Frank or this Hitman guy from Polar in company with younger actors that ""learn"" from them and travel with them. 

I'd rather look for something more similar to Frank and Madani's kinda relationship, because they had more action scenes together and over all their whole bond was thicker and all that stuff, also I didn't like the fact that the girl from Polar was turbo depressed all the time, but I liked the idea of a ""villian"" watching over a younger companion.

Movie/Series where a guy, that commits crimes/does other ""bad guys"" stuff, travels with a younger companion, similar to The Punisher's second season.

"Does anyone know how to get the Netflix app on Roku to not run like crap and crash randomly?

I'm constantly amazed that a company with Netflix's resources can't seem to make an app that doesn't crash or run sluggishly. I unsubscribed from Netflix a year ago because their support was utterly clueless and told me the workaround was to unplug my Roku TV for 1 minute every time the app acts up. Well, that would be fine if it actually fixed it but it doesn't.

So before I start heading back in the unsubscribing direction, does anyone have a clever way to get their garbage app to actually function?

**EDIT:** Scroll down to kneelray's advice. Turning off the auto-play features (options available only through the website) appears to have completely fixed the lag and crashing. Log in to the Netflix website and then go to **account &gt; profile &gt; playback settings &gt; change** and turn off the auto-play features. Note: you have to make this change while logged in as the primary account and change it for every profile if you have more than one.

"I am in the process of transitioning from one Android tablet to another. I had S5E7 of *Suits* still to watch on the old tablet and I meant to download S5E8 on the new one, but I accidentally selected S5E7 instead. Only after adding it to my log (i.e. a spreadsheet where I note everything) did I notice my error and the fact that my first download of this episode, done yesterday, had been 107 MB whereas today’s was 186 MB.

My log doubly confirms the discrepancy: the first took 2m34s to download while the second took 4m25s. The ratio of these times matches the 74% ratio of the sizes.

Needless to say, I checked the settings and the “Download Video Quality” is set to “Standard” on both devices.

What is going on?

Did Netflix – today – revert to the less efficient compression algorithm they had replaced in March 2020?

A [similar question](https://redd.it/cvecwf) in August 2019 included a hypothesis but got no answers.

Another difference for me between yesterday and today is that, in order to download anything on my second device, I had to upgrade my Netflix plan from “Basic” to “Standard”. But why would that force “Full HD” files when the app is set to “Standard”?

"Here’s just a list of the things that are infuriating me about this doc:

1. They have multiple “internet sleuths” as experts. Now, I’m all for the internet sleuthing movement, and I don’t mind them being interviewed if they played a roll in the case (like that don’t mess with cats show), but somebody just blogging about a case does not make them an expert.

2. Somebody said “I’ve spent hundreds of hours on this case.” So a week? You spent a week? So what?

3. Somebody else said they’ve spent hours on the case and disagree with the medical examiner. Jesus, who cares if you do.

4. Multiple people claiming she isn’t acting like she is bipolar because they haven’t seen someone who is bipolar acting that way before. Wow.

5. They are OBSESSED with the hatch being open and claim that’s proof she was thrown in. Um...why couldn’t she close it herself as she went in? Why is that deemed impossible and ignored? Is it more likely it would be left open in that case? Sure, but that doesn’t make the other option impossible.

6. Apparently the Cecil is a hell mouth. They act like evil is drawn there or some bullshit.

I love a Netflix doc drone shot as much as the next guy, but this is seriously one of the most unnecessary true crime docs I’ve ever seen. This story has been done to death before this doc, and if I can get the whole story in a 20 minute YouTube video, you have to give me a reason why you are making a 4 hour doc about it.

Edit: I wanted to say I posted this while starting episode 4. Spoilers, but for them to basically all admit it was probably just an accident and explain why EVERYTHING they brought up in episodes 1-3 was wrong really drove home the pointlessness of this show. I really liked how they handled the story of the musician though.

Edit 2: Those of you saying “you missed the point, the internet sleuths were bad,” you are giving this far too much credit. If that was the point, they wouldn’t have spent 3 eps letting those sleuths spew every conspiracy theory they could think and then let those exact same people debunk them.

"Hello,

so i'm new to this whole 4k thing i just bought a 4k TV From LG ""Series un 7400"" last week, and everything is looking fantastic. But i just noticed that all series and movies are weirdly distorted if i watch netflix from my computer, it is happening everywhere, windows app, edge, etc. And is so annoying, it is not happening if i watch the stuff over the build in app of my TV. But i really don't want to do it that way, as i like having everything set up without having to use the remote everytime i switch from gaming to netflix. I have an RTX 3070. I hope someone can help me. You can see the glitch on the lower right of my tv, it is happening like every few seconds and it's ""taking"" a picture from some scenes ago that glitches.

Okay, this Glitch is so weird, it only happens when i rewind or skip forward in the Video. If i start the Video and just let it play it does not happen, but if i rewind the glitch is starting, which is forcing me to go out of the app and start it again, any idea what and why this is happening?

"How in the hell did she know where the Mafia dude lived from getting the license plate? You need a policeman to get that information for you. Also, aren't drivers from the mafia taught how to tell when they are being tailed? Especially when it's from their home to their place of work by the SAME car?

Where did she get the knockout serum? You just cant pick that up at your local pharmacy.

Where did she get the two tazers? One of them police grade... in such little time?

How did she know what level to go to in the parking garage to kidnap a literal MAFIA BOSS?

She was drugged twice, they put (i'm assuming) alcohol down her gullet to make it seem like she was drinking when the car crashed, why wasn't she still drunk and high as a kite from the drugs but instasober conveniently right before the car crashed? 



Also The Mafia. They would have taken her friend they knocked out at the apartment to the quarry and started to chop off all her fingers in front of her to see where the diamonds were. No info? Ok then. They would have finished killing her friend, then started in on her by chopping the fingers off. That usually breaks most people. After they got the info, they would have confirmed the info then shot her in the face, then buried her in the quarry or just simply left her there. None of this ""make it look natural bullshit"" especially if they are dumping a car in a river. If she's going to go missing, then you dont leave anything up to chance and kill her right then and there and then disappear the body. WTF, dumbest mafia ever.

As for his mom. Why didn't the lawyer guy waltz into the Managers office with the two beefcakes side by side and set the case of  $150 grand down on his table to bribe the release? Why didn't he show pictures of the lady they just killed telling him the jig is up and not to fuck with them? You dont TAZE the fucker in the hallway for everyone to see.

"Just came across this OpEd by Chris Lambert, that helped me understand the reasoning behind the filmmakers' decision to include footage of the web sleuths in the ""*Vanishing...*"" Netflix documentary about Elisa Lam. Reddit is mentioned, which really got my attention. Here are some excerpts:

&gt; There is controversy around the Netflix documentary about the death of 21-year-old Elisa Lam at the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles back in 2013. It mainly centers on the inclusion of “web sleuths” and YouTubers featured in the 4-episode *Crime Scene* series. The controversy boils down to two factors.  
&gt;  
&gt;First, the web sleuths and YouTubers do not come off well in the documentary. Overreaching, obsessive, irresponsible, infuriating—those adjectives about sum up the bulk of the reactions I saw others have (and felt myself).  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s a whole Reddit post with TWENTY-THOUSAND UPVOTES and over 100 awards (kind of a big deal in the Reddit community) that’s titled, “Why I stopped watching the Elisa Lam documentary.”

The point of the article, and I'm paraphrasing is that one explanation for the reasoning behind including the web sleuths is ""Show, don't tell"". 

&gt;So imagine if *Vanishing* simply told us the web sleuths and YouTubers were annoying. Maybe the detective or journalist would say, “The online sleuths and YouTubers spread a lot of misinformation that caused a lot of issues.” We’d probably believe them. But that statement wouldn’t make a lasting impression on us. It’s information rather than experience. There’s no action. No demonstration.  
&gt;

"I use headphones (Sony WH-1000XM3).

* My Netflix plan is ""Premium UHD"" so I have access to Dolby Atmos etc.
* I use Netflix Windows App.
* ""Dolby Atmos for Headphones"" is activated in the ""Spatial sound"" setting, in the Windows 10.

Despite all these, I see no Dolby Atmos in the ""AUDIO"" section when you play a movie, which, of course, has the ""Atmos"" mark on its title page. In contrast, in our home theater (with all the fancy surround speakers) we can see ""5.1 Surround (Dolby Atmos)"" in the ""AUDIO"" section. What should I do to enable Atmos with my headphones?

&amp;#x200B;

**Update)** Apparently it's been working, despite it's just 5.1 Surround. I got to know this by clicking the speaker icon next to the clock on the task bar. When Atmos sound is being processed, there's a message under the volume gauge saying ""Dolby Atmost for headphones in use"". ""Dolby Atmos for Headphones"" is enabled in my Windows 10.

"I’m not going to talk much about it, because it’s very easy to spoil it. All I can say is that I would recommend anybody with access to it to watch it. Phenomenal acting, brilliantly shot, brilliantly written, and an ending that was so much of a punch in the gut that I haven’t stopped thinking about it for nearly a week. 

The scariest thing about the show is that you can’t tell who the villain really is, despite the characters all being on show. It’s a beautifully crafted piece of TV.

"**SPOILER ALERT x SPOILER ALERT!!**

So, I've finished the 4th episode where the psychiatrist David has fired the assistant Louise.

I am loving the series because the acting is amazing, the shots are beautifully done and the character building is so amazing that it'll kill you with slow burn! But it just seems to have a lot of unanswered questions that keep increasing. Does it answer everything in the end or I'm supposed to take those hints and turn them into facts?I think it's taking tooo long to put clarity in the context.

For example:- Adele dreaming and finding that David is cheating on her. Is that a supernatural power or just guestimate dreaming?- Adele waking up from multiple dreams inside dreams (like inception). What's up with that?- Rob dead in the forest (wearing the clothes he was wearing with Adele).

&amp;#x200B;

Hope it's all worth it in the end!

"I’m a pretty big history buff and have studied the sengoku jidai (Japanese Warring state period) on my own. That being said I’m no expert or anything, just a hobby historian. I also understand making documentaries dramatic and stuff. But I wanna give my opinions on this show’s first episode as I haven’t seen anyone else talk about it yet. If y’all are interested I’ll make a post about my final thoughts on the series when I finish it.

Historically speaking. They get a lot of facts right. I like that. They give exact events. People involved, people’s death, battles, who was related to who and in what manner, etc. That being said there’s a handful of subjective stuff that feels like it’s pandering towards weebs. I’m a bit of a weeb myself so I can identify weeb pandering when I see it. Saying the Samurai were the best warriors in history? The katana is the finest sword ever made??? This is stuff hardcore weebs say just because they think everything Japanese is best. Don’t get me wrong, I admire the katana and respect the skill of the Samurai, but you can’t label anything as the best when it comes to history because it’s much more complicated than that. Granted it’s subjective, but it feels like pandering. There’s only one hard thing they try to sell as fact that’s just blatantly wrong. Nobunaga was not the first person to use Ashigaru. Ashigaru had been around for a long time and were extensively used by every faction during this period of Japanese history. They’re also a little off when it comes to weapons. I do like the accuracy when they talk about guns. The specific number Nobunaga used, the advantages and disadvantages, and they weren’t wrong about how Nobunaga helped normalize the use of guns. And while the katana is definitely an iconic weapon every samurai used, they kinda passed up spears/pole arms and the bow. The samurai used bows extensively and I don’t even think they mention it. Bows were one of the reasons others didn’t use guns, because it was said in the early days “a skilled bowman could loose 15 arrows in the time it took a musket man to reload”. Everything else I really like and they did a good job portraying most informative.

When it comes to cinematography I have really just two things to say. This looks great...except why is it so grey and dark. The costumes, the acting, the choreography, everything is great, except this dark filter they have on everything, even the historians talking. Idk why but I personally found this kinda stupid and annoying. I think it’s because it feels like they were trying to go for a Ghosts of Tsushima vibe which makes me feel like this was pandering a little bit. Aside from that, everything else looks great. Normally I’d complain about the chaotic battles with no formation, but the battles they depicted were in fact quite chaotic in the forests so I actually don’t have a problem with that.

Overall I like the show for the most part, it’s mostly accurate but misses a couple things. It does feel like they have a very specific audience they’re trying to pander to at times. Show is too dark and unnecessarily grey, but the costumes and action are amazing. I don’t want my criticism to make the show seem bad, it was just easier to say the few things they did wrong vs everything they did right My first impressions on Age of Samurai Battle for Japan",pretti big histori buff studi sengoku jidai japanes war state period said expert anyth hobbi historian also understand make documentari dramat stuff wanna give opinion show first episod seen anyon els talk yet interest make post final thought seri finish histor speak get lot fact right like give exact event peopl involv peopl death battl relat manner etc said hand subject stuff feel like pander toward weeb bit weeb identifi weeb pander see say samurai best warrior histori katana finest sword ever made stuff hardcor weeb say think everyth japanes best get wrong admir katana respect skill samurai label anyth best come histori much complic grant subject feel like pander one hard thing tri sell fact blatantli wrong nobunaga first person use ashigaru ashigaru around long time extens use everi faction period japanes histori also littl come weapon like accuraci talk gun specif number nobunaga use advantag disadvantag wrong nobunaga help normal use gun katana definit icon weapon everi samurai use kinda pass spear pole arm bow samurai use bow extens even think mention bow one reason other use gun said earli day skill bowman could loos arrow time took musket man reload everyth els realli like good job portray inform come cinematographi realli two thing say look great except grey dark costum act choreographi everyth great except dark filter everyth even historian talk idk person found kinda stupid annoy think feel like tri go ghost tsushima vibe make feel like pander littl bit asid everyth els look great normal complain chaotic battl format battl depict fact quit chaotic forest actual problem overal like show part mostli accur miss coupl thing feel like specif audienc tri pander time show dark unnecessarili grey costum action amaz want critic make show seem bad easier say thing wrong vs everyth right first impress age samurai battl japan,0

"Hey all,

Just finished ""I Care A Lot"". Honestly I thought it was a fairly well put together and entertaining movie/plot.

HOWEVER, I did take issue with Marla being the protagonist. Were we supposed to feel sorry for what happened to her in the end? Were we supposed to take this as some sort of feminist triumph over men?

Like Marla was a horrible horrible person who deserved most of what happened to her (maybe just short of the murder attempt). At not point did I feel like I should be rooting for her to come out on top. Also, I got the impression that we were supposed to feel like she was sticking it to the ""man"", like it somehow empowered women, but if I had a daughter I wouldn't show them a movie that frames a horrible person as the female heroine.

And what is the deal with that ""achieve your dreams""/Crime and Punishment monologue at the beginning/end? Are we supposed to  really think that she was in any way actually successful? She got rich by manipulating people....that is not the universal definition of success...

"I'll start off that i liked The last airbender.... But i loved The Legends of Korra. 

I never watched cartoons or any shit like that. i remember seeing eps of TLAB when i was a teen, but never invested into it. Jumped on nextflix around December and saw it. So i was like hmmm its familiar and something to catch up on, then i saw The Legends Of Korra. Now i was told it was crap and blah blah, but im no sheep ill find thing out for myself. I'm not a super hard guy, but i dont break down unless its a pet or loved that has died. 

&amp;#x200B;

Korra put me into tears... and her ending felt more like a Cliffhanger then a ending. I Mean she says ""there is soo much i want to see and do as this new avatar"" She grows soo much and suffers alot during the way. every enemy she faced took away apart of her. she went from this bratty kid to a strong compassionate woman. And her Love with Asami.... 

&amp;#x200B;

We need more of that. I'm not even gay it feels wrong we cant see them share a kiss or be inlove... We all want to see Korra and Asami be in love, we also want to see this new mature compassionate avatar in at least 2 more seasons. What could a future story arc be?

Well do the comics but with animation... Comics are fillers, not story tellers, these comics take to long and rush through everything. I mean there is bugger all story... anyway Animate the comics fill them out give them more story... 

Then the last season we see Korra at 26 awaken from a nightmare seeing Aang fight off dark spirits. Asami is woken up by Korra to ask what happened. for korra to just say it was a past lifes nightmare... She might no longer connected to them but she is still a part of that cycle... 2 days later spirits start pouring out of a portal for Korra to investigate, She goes and askes a spirit what is going on it replies with ""your kind as destorying the spirit world"" Korra replies ""humans have not been destroying the spirit world"" the spirit would reply with ""NO! your kind avatar!"" So this could be a season where she finds out the past lives wernt destroyed... they where disconnected from Rava when she was destroyed....   
Rava is a nexus, she connected all the Past and current avatars together, and when rava died. they thought Korra died in avatar state and the cycle was broken.

These past lives went out into the spirit world to find other avatars that where out and got lost when this all happened. and 80% that left were caught by bad spirits that had messed with avatars and imprisoned or devoured them...

Yes it had a ending. but that ending was because of necolodens Foot on their neck. they pretty much destroyed the show. She-ra is done and you guys have Studio Mer who animated Korra.

"Hi All,

I recently got a 4k TCL C716 TV mainly to watch Netflix in 4k. TCLs packaging has the Netflix logo all over it so assumed its officially compatible. The quality of the TVs software is awful (not been updated in my region, full of security holes) and one of the remotes was broken.

Anyway, when I watch FHD content - i.e. shows that support 1080p only - it looks really good. But when I watch any 4k content then there is a ""static"" or coloured dot effect over the whole picture which is extremely noticeable. This effect isn't noticeable in YouTube or other apps. There also doesn't seem to be a way to force the TV to play 4k content in 1080p (although obviously this would defeat the point of the TV!).

I checked the TV Netflix app and it reports 90Mbps to Netflix. Fast.com from a web browser reports 33Mbps (compared to 430Mbps on the computer....), however, in video stats say 15.25Mbps. It doesn't look like a compression artifact though.

I talked to Netflix support and they weren't able to suggest anything. I'm really confused if this is likely to be a Netflix app issue, the TV just being generally bad (wouldn't recommend TCL) or something else.

Wanted to see if anyone on here has the same experience or any suggestions?

"I am not even gonna go into the mental gymnastics the viewer is required to take in order to root for the scum of human being that Marla is. At the end of the day, she is a con artist taking advantage of vulnerable elder people to steal their property.

I just wanna focus on the incredible and improbable mess that occurs after Marla and Frankie are apprehended by Tyrion's men and how it heavily relies on a major dose of suspension of disbelief. 

1. Marla says the easiest way to solve their issue is for Tyrion to pay her 10 million and they both go their ways. Tyrion rejects that and decides to kill her. Wouldn't the actual easiest option be to simply force Marla to sign some sort of legal document releasing Ms Peterson from her guardianship? Marla definitely has a way to accomplish this as we see in the end that Ms Peterson is released from the psychiatric facility and reunited with her son. Also, Tyrion's men already have Frankie so they could somehow use that as leverage to force Marla into giving up. 
2. Anybody who has ever seen a crime movie (or has the tiniest bit of common sense) knows that a henchman/hitman would make sure the person they are told to kill is actually dead. However, both for Frankie and Marla, the henchmen apparently simply thought it was over and went about their nights. Would have hurt for them to stand by the lake and make sure Marla did not somehow escaped? Would have hurt for them to stand by the apartment until it blew up?
3. Are we really supposed to believe a middle aged woman (would say the same thing if it was a middle aged man) was able to single-handedly defeat the security team of Russian mobster? Not only that, but it was somewhat convenient that right when Marla was at the driver's house he was about to leave to meet Tyrion. It was very convenient that the bathroom Marla asked the front desk guy about was in the direction of a door towards the executive parking promptly open by someone else. And it was extremely convenient than in a massive office building with a bunch of parking levels she was able to find exactly Tyrion's driver right around the corner. 
4. A Russian mobster only has one security guard? 
5. How did Marla end up at/find the hospital where Tyrion was taken and how she managed to be assigned as her legal guardian so they could have this extremely productive business meeting?

It might not seem like it, but I did enjoy the movie and felt like it was going in a great direction right before this mess. Guess that's what happens when you just can't figure out how to tie everything up for the conclusion.

It would be a great visual representation to see the connections and relations of the tribes.

Here are the infos, which I remember:

The Crows are located near Barthok --&gt; Berlin (and eastern Germany probably)

The Femen are south-west of them, near Leipzig, if I am not mistaken

The Crimson should be somewhere further to the west, correct? I think we don't know where their new capital is located (Ahrenberg) - if i would guess, probably somewhere in Benelux, since they spoke Dutch in the 2 episode. --&gt; But they were also next to Little Praha, which would be to the south of Crows again...

There is the northern Kingdom (probably Skandinavian?) where the life is great, as Moses says

"I just got finished erasing from my Ipad the fictional cast and their relation to each other. For those who have not seen it, this is from memory, but it might help you avoid rewatching the first two episodes. The story is told in flashback from 2017, when literally everyone in the isolated Alpine town of Valmoline comes together to celebrate a marriage between two couples: Manu and Adele; and Laurent and Erika (see below).

**1997**\-- The chalet's tenants: **Jean-Louis Rodier** (writer, not from Valmoline); **Francoise**, (his wife, **from** Valmoline); **Julien** (the Rodiers' thirteen-year-old son); **Amelie** (their very young daughter). **Alexandre** (Francoise's hermit cousin).

Town locals: **Philippe** (a former admirer and perhaps lover of Francoise) ; **Muriel**, (his unmarried sister); **Florence** (Philippe's shopkeeper/souvenir-hut-owning wife); **Etienne** (a guy in love with Muriel and angry at her instant infatuation with the suave Jean-Louis); **Christine** (a relation, possibly sister, of Etienne). **Milou**, Valmoline's cabinet-maker, employs **Gaspard**, who drinks a lot with Philippe and Etienne. Milou is the father of the coveted young Alice, rivalry over whom brings Julien (see above) to blows--and then some--with Sebastian, Laurent, and Thierry.

The integral adolescent cast includes as thirteen-year-olds Philippe's sons, **Laurent** and **Thierry.** They do not speak in the 1997 segment but appear as ""muscle"" for the local bully, **Sebastian**. Sebastian is Etienne's son and in love with **Alice.**  Finally, there is **Manu**, not a local boy, but one whom both Alice and Sebastian claim as BFFs during Manu's summer visits. The viewer never meets Manu's parents.

**2017**\-- Laurent brings **Erika (blonde)** to a train station in Chambery. They are going to marry in Valmoline (God only knows where :). Thierry brings **Tiphaine (redhead)**, his girlfriend. Manu, having already arrived by car with **Adele (blonde)**, greets his business partner, **Olivier**, and Olivier's partner **Mathilde**, and her very young daughter **Leonore**. Sebastian also arrives by car with **Maud**, a gorgeous  and friendly showroom model in the car-importing business Sebastian has built for himself with funds whose source the unfolding series eventually explains.

That said, I found the whole thing almost unbearable. It’s one of the worst films I’ve had the misfortune of watching.

The writing is banal, the acting is embarrassing. Everyone seem to have a different accent even though they’re supposed to come from the same tiny village (probably this won’t be evident to those watching it in English)

The characters keep on saying and doing things that don’t make any sense. Their motivations are never clear. What pushes them, their struggles, have to be explained through unnatural dialogue because the film just can’t seem to show them.

There is supposed to be a strong social commentary but it’s really not there.

"I'm not sure if anyone else has any experience with this, but generally searching for Audio in (language) will return all of the shows that have audio/dubbing in that language. It seems to work consistently for every language I have tried except for one result that appears to be a bug. When I search for Audio in Catalan all of the shows that result from the search have Catalan audio except for Card Captor Sakura. I can't tell if this is a bug where this should not return in the results because US Netflix does not have the licensing or if Netflix has the correct licensing but there is a bug enabling the audio. It has European Spanish dubbing and Netflix Spain has it in Catalan, so my guess is the former. It's also possible I'm wrong and the search doesn't work in the way it seems like it should, so I'd appreciate knowing if other people have had seen similar things and I'm just barking up the wrong tree.

"One point of frustration I have found with Netflix is that for a number of titles they serve up blurry washed-out encodes. A good example of this in action is Riverdale. Feeling frustrated recently about this I set about to do some investigation after determining elsewhere that it was possible to get better picture quality than what I was receiving.

Long story short, the official Windows 10 app on Windows 20H2 receives video in AVC at half the bitrate of the new Edge browser which receives it in AVCHIGH at the bitrate you are paying for. 

With the bitrate cut 50% for the 1920x1080 resolution using the official Netflix Windows 10 app, you would actually get better picture quality in comparison using silverlight at 720p instead.

Unfortunately, using Netflix in a browser doesn't give you a choice between 5.1 and 2.0 sound which the app does, but picture quality is more important to me so I am forced to use the new Edge browser.

I have no idea how they got the rights to use that (maybe it's something both they and EA got from a generic music source) but there is also a familiar song used right before judging that is hitting me right in a familiar place in my nostalgic heart.

If you watch the scene right before judgement where they're filming over the various sculptures where they're displayed, they play this magical song that sounds like it's played on a vibrophone or something similar. I KNOW I've heard this song before - maybe even from a prominent movie or something from my childhood. I can't for the life of me figure out where it's from though. Can anyone give it a listen and see if they recognize where it's from?

"So I’ve been watching Silence directed by Martin Scorsese. I don’t have the sharpest hearing so I need subtitles to be able to keep up with the movie. 

What I’ve noticed is that when English subtitles are enabled, subtitles only appear for dialogues where the characters speak English.

However, when the dialogue is spoken in Japanese, no translated English subtitles are present, so effectively I’m missing out on a chunk of the movie since there’s a lot of Japanese dialogue present. Adding to this, when I disabled the subtitles option, subtitles automatically appear for the Japanese dialogue translated to English.

Is there any way to perhaps enable English subtitles for both English and Japanese dialogue for this film? I’ve seen Inglourious Basterds and all dialogue for that film, whether English, French or German, have English subtitles present when it’s enabled, so how come the same isn’t done for Silence?

"So I imagine this is an unpopular opinion but netflix movie trailers are far too long and give away way too much of the film. Im not sure how long the trailer is, but after watching the trailer to Yes Day, a netflix family film that is coming on 12 march. I feel I no longer have to watch it.

The trailer was so long it includes so many details about the film and showed me so many clips that I feel I don't actually need to watch the film. 

I was excited for the first 30 seconds, it looked like a really good family film. Now I lost all excitement and will honeslty skip it because the trailer was too generous and gave away the whole film. 

It's a shame netflix does this. I remember trailers being 60 seconds long and leaving me with excitement to watch it, but netflix trailers are just so long it's basically a mini recap of the film itself.

"Spoilers if you haven't watched it...

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to put my thoughts into words, but I'm also not the best reviewer so.. yeah:

I watched the Cecil Hotel documentary the other day and when I finished it, I felt frustrated. The more it’s come up in conversation, of which has not yet been very positive, I’ve felt a seething anger at the documentary more and more and I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not even bad, it’s just outright disrespectful and imo a disgusting approach to telling a story.

First of all, the actual documentary is \~decent\~ and as somebody who knew the bare minimum of this case (based on spooky videos I watched when I was 15), I felt rather informed by it. Its first two episodes do a good job in telling the situation of the case, the context is a bit mix-matched and the manager makes me uncomfortable, but overall, the set up and the story of the case was a standard documentary. I’m pretty sure I could have stopped there and felt pretty satisfied with the documentary.

However, its primarily the third episode which frustrated me the most, or at least it’s complete tonal contradiction to the final episode. You see, part 3 explains the different theories based around Elisa Lam, which are all highlights of Web Sleuth culture. Ridiculous theories based on silly information, which is fair enough if you’re covering this topic and all – but to entertain these theories is completely disrespectful to the following episode, which I will touch on soon. At no point does it really give any sense of validity to these ideas and ultimately, they’re played off as cooky conspiracies, which I won’t lie – they pretty much are. I spent the duration of the ‘horror movie in action’ theory rolling my eyes and actually muttering to myself “and what?”, because it’s stupid. The theory Elisa Lam was a secret agent sent to spread TB? Good movie plot about corruption, bad take on a woman’s tragic death. It also entertains paranormal activity and all these ridiculous ideas, and it angers me so much.

The primary issue I have with episode 3 is that it is quickly followed by a huge tonal shift, centred around a message about Elisa Lam’s mental health. It’s only until episode 4 we learn a lot of key information for what most likely happened (her medication, her depression, her strange activity). Episode 4 appears to set out about mental health and its connection to this tragic tale of a woman’s death. We even see Morbid who may discomfort me with his art style, but nonetheless is a victim of the web sleuths. And while the episode appears to focus on this and focus on the crippling affects it had on him, it still entertained these ridiculous notions the episode earlier. It glorified these people, despite the next episode having this façade and pretence of passionate take on mental health. It’s disgusting.

It’s completely problematic and I’ve not seen such a half-assed and shallow message on mental health in my life. Were this a documentary about the Cecil Hotel alone, it would work with an episode or a segment on Elisa Lam, detailing the case and how she met her tragic fate related to her suffering mental health, it would work. Were this ultimately a take on web sleuth culture, the crippling damages it can have on the web sleuth, the people they pursue and the investigations they seek out, it would work. But no. Instead, the final episode concludes the intended message of mental health, as though it hadn’t spent the past episode entertaining such ridiculous theories for an hour. It acts as though it skipped past the affects on Morbid. It shed no light on the family, their struggle dealing with the loss of a daughter and a sister – nor her friends. In the end, the documentary is a disrespectful and shallow attempt to entice web sleuths into an internet mystery and ultimately wrap it up in a nice, cute message about awareness to mental illness, as though the makers really cared about that final message, as opposed to explaining the mystery?

I genuinely have so many issues with this and it really angers me how they approached this genuinely tragic story. I do think the historian and I believe sociologists (I may be wrong, but the woman who discusses Elisa Lam and the man who discusses the homeless population in skid row) were on right tracks of approaching this story. The web sleuths seem so detached from the actual case and I can’t explain how uncomfortable it is to see one of the main web sleuths say how he had someone go to her grave and touch it for him, as though she’s barely a person? I don’t know, it’s just the web sleuths don’t feel as though they fully understand what they’re in the midst in and while I appreciated one of the web sleuths’ reflections on his actions, the whole ordeal fully showcases why you shouldn’t entertain these theories, because you attract detached people from the original case. They felt inconvenienced and ultimately dissatisfied with the likely answer, which is apparently is the ultimate message of the documentary?

Maybe I’m overthinking it, but I’ve actually never been so outraged in my life by a show and the more I think about it, the more frustrated I get? I think the documentary is okay, it’s pretty bad but it’s actual case study (bar episode 3) somewhat works. It’s interesting, but it’s focusing on the wrong thing, which ultimately makes its final message feel super disingenuous. I feel informed, which a documentary should seek out to do, but these producers had this final episode in mind when shooting the 3rd, and yet despite having dedicated the final episode to a mental health message, still entertained these ridiculous and irrelevant, ungrounded and frustrating theories.

"I got tired of it being all about Gil ""I have no chin"" Carillo and his hero Frank Salerno. There was very little info about Ramirez himself. They didn't go into at all about his childhood, his crazy cousin Mike who probably played a huge role in Ramirez becoming a sociopath. To be honest this documentary glorified the role of the cops way too much considering they FAILED over and over to catch this guy while he was in the middle of his crime spree and it wasn't until a DIFFERENT cop in Northern California who is barely featured in the documentary strong armed a civilian into giving up Ramirez name that they finally got the lead on the guy they needed. And then in the end we have Carillo crying and talking about how much it meant to him to catch this guy and on and on and he had fuck all to do with it as far as I could see.

When I first started with Netflix they had a ton of good movies but now it seems like all they have is original content. I'm not a fan of a lot of the original content. I like the non original content more but I struggle to find anything I want to watch or if I do it is usually something in my list that is going to expire. Right now the majority of my list is original content that I added years ago that I don't feel like watching. I wish that had better content as I could spend a while looking and not find anything I feel like watching. Only a handful of original content that I enjoy. I just wish they had a better selection of things to watch. Are most of the good movies not available on us Netflix and only available in other countries? Unless you are a fan of the original content there doesn't seem to be any worth watching on Netflix aside from the few non original movies.

"Ron Howard's new docusieries goes above and beyond to show the desperation to teach everyone what mental illness is. Heres a deep dive.

At the center of this murder mystery is one of the most bizarre surveillance videos you'll ever see, showing 3 or 4 minutes of the last known movements of a missing Canadian 21 year old woman traveling in LA at a Skid Row hotel. But in this current pandemic-driven era of binging and intense, en masse thought provoking, it was actually more fascinating to me getting to know the multitude of narrators. Because when we step outside the world of toxic polarizing politics, we see that as human beings, its far more important and interesting to glean how and why people act how they act, and what these behaviors say about people. Here's some things and people I found fascinating!
1) The Cecil Hotel Manager - OK let's get this one out of the way 1st- everyone is going to have an opinion about this woman- she's a TRIP! Possibly the most naive person on the face of this Earth, (she comments about the hotel she runs on Skid Row, ""I saw an officer with his gun drawn in the hallway and was like 'wait what's going on here?""), she is someone I want to grab by the shoulders on around 2 dozen different occasions and shake (softly!) and say ""How are you just realizing this?!? Wake up girl!."" But I think it is wrong to not point out that this is a girl from the middle of the country that has no city experience decides to go into the heart of skid row Los Angeles one of the most dangerous places in America and take over a hotel with the worst reputation imaginable and make it a better place and she's the woman up for that job. That takes courage that takes balls that I wish I had and that I wish we all had. My hat goes after her Come out with all her eccentricities, she at times comes off as flawed but no more or less than any of us. 
2) Conspiracy theories- These days it seems like maybe because of the time everybody has on their hands that conspiracy theories are more rampant than ever before. Now, I started thinking, how many conspiracy theories have ever come to light as actual explanations to mysteries? Maybe somebody out there can point to things once considered conspiracies theories that turned out to be true, but I know of none. In this case, we see how true this is. The name of the 
3) Paranormal Activity, and the proclivity to assume it does actually exist, and is to blame for negative or strange events. I blame nobody for believing what they want to believe that is a right that we all have. But assuming paranormal activity might be at fault for anything that has happened will put you in a rabbit hole that will never end in a positive manner and for those that do believe in paranormal activity, Maybe it does maybe it doesn't, but let's not swear our credibility on it. Especially in a missing person case. 
4) Web sleuths. Here is a great example of how grouping people into one type or moniker is usually never a good thing to do, because not everybody who decided to try and help this investigation was necessarily hurtful to the investigation or guilty of pointing pointing their finger at innocent people. Now this isn't to say that We shouldn't feel sympathy for the metal singer who was falsely accused and put some blame on those who made his life so difficult that he attempted suicide. But I have to point to 2 things in this docuseries that really are heartwarming. The couple that films the hotel Really does fascinating and helpful work that, Had she been murdered could have opened a lot of doors as to the reason. 
But the star here is John Siobhan, the soft spoken, mild mannered person that took interest. When he mentions that after reading her blog how he felt heartbroken and infuriated at the same time we come to know him and realise that here is somebody that is so empathetic and so smart... How come we all don't raise our children the way his parents did so that he came out that way? And how come we don't make him president of this country for life because I fell in love with this person during this film and if he ever happens to read this my hat goes off to you sir you are the best of us.
5) Coincidences. Oh, you darn coincidences. David Lynch once wrote in Lost Highway, ""I don't believe in bad coincidences. Coincidences spook us out for sure because they are mathematical anomalies. But here's the thing, if coincidence didn't exist then somebody mathematic like myself would be really worried because it is an absolute certainty that the more people on Earth exist, living their lives, the more mathematical coincidences will occur. And the more people there are LOOKING for answers to things, the more coincidences there will be. Coincidences exist, you'll run into plenty in your life, and they'll be just that, random, mathematical coincidences. 
6) Mental illness, and its prominence in society- As someone with a fairly severe mental illness, I know far more than I want to about mental illnesses. Over the course of my life, having spent several days in treatment facilities, it became clear to me early in life that mental illnesses are no different than physical ones in their degrees of harmfulness, except that they're easier to ignore because they aren't physically noticeable to others much of the time, as they're occurring in the afflicted's brains, hidden from the world, and only actually provable in a brain scan. But its important for those unafflicted to become more aware that the behaviors of those that are. 
This is even more evident when these youtubers start Commenting about how her bipolar disorder definitely could not be the reason that she was found dead. Here's the problem, these people that say this clearly have never met anybody or cared about anybody who is afflicted with bipolar disorder. It is one of the most savagely terrible things that can occur in the brain and can cause the best person in the world to act as irrational and dangerous and poor mannered to act unruly. As soon as Her death is ruled because of her bipolar disorder, there is a frenzy of doubt that pops up and that really points even more directly to the fact that people who don't know how serious and how potentially deadly serious chemical imbalances are. And it almost doesn't matter whether that is actually why she died or not, The bigger issue here is that Mental illness is something that needs to be destigmatised, talked about more in AND out of the medical community, and FAR more money needs to be allotted by the government to help those afflicted. 
But as I can attest to personally, When somebody has mental disorder even the most loving parents are left in the dark most of the time and if they don't have the time and resources to do the research it's very hard for them to realise the real degree of severity of their child's illness. Elisa's parents NEVER Should have allowed her to travel on her own. Now of course she was an adult and she could do whatever she wanted to, But this is why it's even more important to make sure that parents are well aware and understand early on that they are going to have to do things that most parents won't even deep into their child's life to help protect themselves from a sickness that there is no cure too and that there is only differing degrees of help for, And in a lot of cases as we tragically see here, it is so easy for somebody with mental illness to not take their medication even for a short period of time and have their behaviour change radically on a dime. Obviously her parents are not to blame, but I think what we need to take from this is that it is just a terrible tragedy how little amounts of information and help are out there that need to be. 
I think Elisa would want nothing more than to have helped change these unfortunate, terrible facts. And my hat goes off and I just have so much love and respect for Ron Howard and Brian glazer who made this movie. I believe they are well aware of how tragic mental illness really is and how much more information and attention and money and help and all of that needs to go to mental illness and they wanted to help and they realised that just talking about it has yet to work. So by putting this absolutely fascinating documentary together, that pulls anybody who watches it into it, By the end, hopefully you take this away from the movie. Was a loving good person that was trying to find herself just like we all do at that age and she wanted to travel and she had ambition and she tried to make something happen that would improve her life, but because mental illness is still to this day just a huge stigma that The vast amount of the public has no idea about how serious and how silent and hard to notice mental illness is. Read about it. Watch this film. Accept That it was mental illness that caused her death and that you might know somebody or several people that are afflicted and just bof them and realise that they may not be acting in A way that they want to or that reflects who they are.

"Netflix completely Hollywoodized the poor girl's death.

There was no real mystery, the last 30 minutes of the final episode suddenly reveals the clear reason why she is likely to have died.

The first 3.5 episodes just create a completely false sense of mystery and suspense. The police figured out the real reason behind her death and the producers of this documentary clearly asked them to bullshit their initial thoughts for 3.5 hours to keep people guessing.

It's also completely all over the place, just random clips of internet sleuths giving their conjecture opinions, and then the show uses special effects to exaggerate what they say.

What does everyone else think? I think they hit it big time with the Docu-entertainment Tiger King and are now looking for all sorts of mysteries which they can pad out into 4+ low budget conjecture-infected episodes to keep people watching.

I think Docu-entertainment has a limit. Tiger King is a good balance - it charts a story. But this, this is just pointless, why waste the audience's time with bullshit for 3.5 episodes only to suddenly change track and solve the mystery?

It's disrespectful to Elisa and her family. The show should have been 45 min long: a quick intro to the history of Cecil Hotel, a quick intro to the situation, and then the answer.

"I'm having a difficult time finding decent shows on Netflix lately. I think the quality has been deteriorating for awhile. They give celebrities or famous people huge production deals instead of finding fresh new talent. Almost all the shows or movies that I watch now are foreign which says something about the quality of the U.S. shows and movies. I recently watched Hinterland, The Woods and a few others. 

When I saw the trailer for Red Dot it looked interesting so I decided to watch. It was clear from the beginning that their assumption that the racist brothers were responsible was wrong. But it's not clear if the brothers were helping the person who actually wanted to kill them. The brother who is also a rescue person points a gun at them as if he is going to shoot them while they're hiding but then he is surprised when he seem them captured and about to be killed. The other brother is confused when Nadja starts backing away from him so he doesn't seem involved. 

When the brother enters the room where Thomas has Nadja and David he is shot by Thomas and David rushes over the untie Nadja. David has a power drill in his hand. Wouldn't it make more sense to kill Thomas with the drill while he is fighting with Jarmo? And why did it take so much time for Thomas to go after Nadja and David after they escaped? He wasn't injured so he must have quickly killed Jarmo. But the most frustrating part of the movie was the ending. It would have preferred the pregnant woman lived but is it believable that an intelligent woman in medical school would be overwhelmed with passion that she would attempt to fondle her boyfriend's penis while he was DRIVING A CAR. I mean COME ON. That isn't something a teenager would do let alone an intelligent medical school student. Also Thomas let his child play with a drone without any supervision but now thinks of himself as a victim when he was irresponsible. Also didn't the boy hear the car approaching? Anyway I was disappointed. I have read some excellent books from Sweden such as The Snowman and was hoping the writing on this movie would be as good as the writing in Nesbo books but it was a disappointment .

"Netflix really needs to do a better job of advertising this Original.

If you like Guardians of the Galaxy, Anime or Star Wars, you should watch this one.

Its a fun space action adventure, the CGI is a little bit dated but they use it sparingly. 

The movie borrows alot of its visuals from Guardians, The Fifth Element, and a little bit of Snow Piercer. The characters are very much inspired from generic sci fi anime characters.

Act 1 is kind of a cliché sci fi slog but the film really hits its stride in Act 2...

Its a fun movie! Korean Cinema loves to appease cinephiles. Half the movie is in English and the other half is korean, for those of you adverse to subtitles. Its like they wanted to make a easy to watch action adventure movie that could get people who dont like subtitles to watch. And i think they accomplished their goal. They made a Scfi action romp with anime influence that tries to appeal mainstream audience.

"The brief was “Your finished pieces should be an inspiration for people to think about the environment and to make the changes that they can to protect our planet. “

Absolutely nothing about that brief speaks to me of creating a piece which communicates “hope” and I’d argue none of the others felt that way either. 

They created images of disaster and warning. People eating the forests. A forest balancing precariously. Ugly fast food and an ice berg wrapped up in a to-go container. 

They created pieces to inspire people to think about the environment. 

I felt like I was going crazy, like I was being gas-lit, when the guest judge is walking through the gallery and criticizing pieces for not communicating “Hope”. That wasn’t the damn prompt!

"If you are not familiar with the case of Kenneka Jenkins, you can read about it [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Kenneka_Jenkins) and also check out my Reddit post about her [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/UnsolvedMurders/comments/l50h3c/the_real_question_no_one_is_asking_about_kenneka/) and you can see the video footage from the hotel [here](https://youtu.be/MmVYbeNyYEo) 


I’ve known about both the Elisa Lam and the Kenneka Jenkins cases for a while now. When I first read about the death of Elisa Lam, maybe for the first few weeks or so, I was convinced that she was killed. However after spending a lot of time researching the facts of the case and hearing almost every opinion that there was, it just makes sense to me that she died accidentally. (I pretty much think that she was off her medication and decided to climb up on the roof of the Cecil because she was in a manic episode and wanted to experience the rush/thrill and or see the skyline, and fell inside the water tank where she was unable to get out. 

I have spent even more time looking over Kenneka’s case and I just can not find any logical conclusion that could explain why she ended up in the freezer. I have seen every surveillance video, every report, every witness statement, every autopsy photograph, every social media post, pretty much every single thing that has been released to the public in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act. 

Still with all of this information, nothing convinces me in the slightest way that she voluntarily went into that freezer and stayed in there until her death. There is just no way. 

I really wish that the circumstances surrounding her death could be explained away as logically as they can with Elisa’s but they just can’t. 

The release of Elisas Netflix documentary has me thinking more and more about Kennekas case and I wanted to know what everyone thinks as well.

"# Trust,

Is important in relationships, Trust is hardcore, without trust, your partner would most likely be [carried away by a big bird](https://twitter.com/mindflakes/status/1152165761554821120), and unless you want that to happen, trust them.

This is exactly what’s conveyed in “To all the boys, Always and Forever: The movie”. It’s about trust and love and hope and fighting problems and Lara not letting Peter get carried away by a big bird and vice versa.

It’s also about having such a relationship that neither of you hold each other back. The movie definitely is a bit of a cliche but it’s a good type of cliche.

**It’s the type of cliche that you don’t mind it being a cliche- the good times, the sad times and despite the pain and the process- everyone gets a happy ending.**

It’s a perfect Valentine’s day watch, especially if you’re single- it can give you a bit of an insight into how relationships actually work- how the relationships that last, work.

This movie is basically about Lara Jean getting accepted into a college far away from Peter’s. They wouldn’t be able to see each other everyday, unlike what they’d first envisioned and it’s clear the both of them think that the separation would get to them, signalling the end of their relationship.

**The entire series is something people can relate to- getting embarrassed by your boyfriend’s ex who’s so clearly jealous of you, parent issues, school issues, your boyfriend’s issues, your sister issues, your issues- no matter how tiny all these problems may seem compared to the big plot- it all adds up.**

It’s all relatable and it’s all happening in the blink of an eye- this just makes the movie 2X exciting.

The final film Always and Forever serves the Internet generation.

Like a conventional high school rom-com, it has a damsel in distress, a charmingly protective boyfriend, fears of separation and a flashy prom. Yet it manages to be refreshing and enjoyable.

This movie is a successful example of how you can make cliche’s work, both by defying them and by abiding by them.

All of Lara and Peter’s decisions are doable, you yourself would have made the same decisions if you were in their shoes. The aesthetic of the movie is also something to talk about- it’s a classic Lara Jean aesthetic- pink and blue and yellow and green: the aesthetic of the movie also makes you want to stay. It also has a satisfying ending

They should’ve sent Chris Taylor home instead of Jason. The point was to do something cartoony/ comic book like. He made pencils as political satire for free speech and free press . He completely ignored the brief and his piece looks like a jar of colored pencils not even a pen which would be more professional or something that focuses on press and journalist. The man seems a bit arrogant because he stated Chris Taylor doesn’t do goggly eyes and a few of his students were guest judges and a Alexander from last season. Im sorry but I matter your reputation or past achievements if you can’t follow the brief and do something out of your comfort zone your not going to be able to push yourself and be truly great A rat walking a cockroach on a leash works. An animal doing human things is something that fits cartoons.anyways I just don’t see Chris winning he’s too stoic and doesn’t have enough creativity to push boundaries.

"I just watched this limited series last night and for my opinion its not the best series i have watched and also not the worst i mean there are some good stuff in the series but i think netflix should've just made this a short length film. So i made a list of what are the best parts and what are the worst parts of the series.


Best Parts

1. How they found Elisa Lam's elevator footage 
2. Two europeans show the the experience at the hotel
3. The history and related stories about the hotel (including Skid Row)
4. Analyzing Elisa Lam's steps of how she got to the water tank and how she got to the cecil hotel instead of Stay on main hotel.
5. The police investigating the whole hotel (well kinda the best)

Worst/Cringey Parts
1. The Youtubers/Bloggers ""acting"" like detectives and using Elisa for content and money which is very offensive.
2. Too much useless information
3. Making Elisa Lam's tumblr posts public
4. Police investigation at the Cecil hotel's rooftop
5. Too much unrelated and off topic theories
6. The internet users are being to personal like the guy that said ""I felt like i lost a sister"" and the other people who just denies the test result and blame other people for Elisa Lam's death.
7. Very bad video editing

So i will talk about the bad/cringey parts only. 

I hate that the Youtubers/Bloggers keep acting like detectives but does not do what a detective was supposed to do they literally didn't do anything to help to the LAPD like they just literally go to the hotel and walk around and they even go to the parts of the hotel where he/she/they should not even go to.

And i also hate the guy who made the facebook group about Elisa Lam because he was being to personal and i really think he was faking it because what kind of guy or girl would share their personal feelings to the public you will just literally get more hate for that.

I also hate the people who denies the test result like they know how to this stuff i mean what they only know is to make damn useless theories and most importantly of how they blamed that artist who literally lost his career because of them and got hate messages for 7 years straight. 

I love that they put many information to this series but some of them are just not that important and will probably just waste your time.

Whoever are the police officers check the rooftop should have been more responsible just because your dog doesn't smell anything you still need to check the water tank.

And they should've have not made Elisa Lam's tumblr post public because again it was like a diary to her meaning its personal and you should not share it to the public no matter what.


So even if the LAPD, Government and the Cecil hotel employees made mistakes i still blame the internet users for this because they literally used Elisa Lam for content and money and they literally ruuned tge lives of the people they blamed. And about the General Manager i feel her it wasn't easy to change a hotel full of serial killers and homeless peopleand if she gets used to it it's still a very hard task so the real antagonist of this case are The internet users who denied the result, blamed innocent people and used Elisa Lam.

My rating for this mini series is
4.5/10

"No one is saying Disney is lacking content or anything. Content wise, Disney is Disney. They own everything, so of course they have plenty of content. 

My beef, is that their app, at least on PS4, is hot garbage. 

Autoplay has been broken for a month, since it was broken in an update. I just downloaded the latest update today...Still broken. Known issue, that should be easy enough to roll back and resolve...Still broken a month later. 

You have any idea how frustrating it is to stop what you're doing every 5 minutes, so you can hit a button, so your kids can watch that next episode of Bluey? Cute show, but episodes are about the length of a commercial, and manually intervening 10 times an hour is cancer. And now, fresh new pain in the butt, it doesn't even start the next episode. It just keeps playing the same episode over and over again. You can't select which episode you want to watch from the drop down list, and continue watching just keeps resetting the same episode. That's not available from the continue menu.

Now that sucks, but you know what's worse? When you watch the last episode, it just disappears from your play list, and you have to search for it again. Now, despite you having searched for the same title a dozen times this week, the app still makes you jump through the hoops. There are streaming services that probably shouldn't track your search history. This isn't one of them. 

Cool, you've found the show again. Hit play. Maybe 10% of the time, you're met with the blue spinning wheel of shame. Sorry, we can't load that content at this time. Why? Because the app is a ""heavier"" stream than any of the other services, and struggles from time to time, even with high speed internet.

Again, I'm not here saying ""Disney bad hur dur."" It's great to watch a cartoon from your childhood with your own kid, and the content selection is good, even if it's pretty lacking for adults. 

The problem is, that relative to Hulu, YouTube, Twitch, Netflix, and Amazon, Disney has the worst app. There's no reason that they should have such inferior delivery of their content, after they've been around this long. 

And it's never acceptable for updates you release into production to keep breaking things. Sure it happens sometimes. But every other company in the world doubles down to fix their mistakes. Leaving features broken for a month, that you broke during an update, while raising your prices at the same time? Any other service would be hemorrhaging subscribers. 

But it's Disney...And they've got all the content...So our subscription remains. It would just be nice to see them keep up with every other service on the technical side. Is this really the best Disney can do?",one say lack content anyth content wise everyth cours plenti content beef app least ps hot garbag autoplay broken month sinc broken updat download latest updat today still broken known issu easi enough roll back resolv still broken month later idea frustrat stop everi minut hit button kid watch next episod bluey cute show episod length commerci manual interven time hour cancer fresh new pain butt even start next episod keep play episod select episod want watch drop list continu watch keep reset episod avail continu menu suck know wors watch last episod disappear play list search despit search titl dozen time week app still make jump hoop stream servic probabl track search histori one cool found show hit play mayb time met blue spin wheel shame sorri load content time app heavier stream servic struggl time time even high speed internet say bad hur dur great watch cartoon childhood kid content select good even pretti lack adult problem rel hulu youtub twitch amazon worst app reason inferior deliveri content around long never accept updat releas product keep break thing sure happen sometim everi compani world doubl fix mistak leav featur broken month broke updat rais price time servic would hemorrhag subscrib got content subscript remain would nice see keep everi servic technic side realli best,1

"“Raya and the Last Dragon” takes us on an exciting, epic journey to the fantasy world of Kumandra, where humans and dragons lived together long ago in harmony. But when an evil force threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, that same evil has returned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people. However, along her journey, she’ll learn that it’ll take more than a dragon to save the world—it’s going to take trust and teamwork as well.

Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada are directing, with Paul Briggs and John Ripa co-directing. Osnat Shurer and Peter Del Vecho are the producers, and Qui Nguyen and Adele Lim are the writers on the project.

Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Raya and the Last Dragon’' will be available on Disney+ with Premier Access in most Disney+ markets, at the same time as it is released in select theaters on March 5, 2021.

"I have an issue with Disney Plus. 
I haven't had any other streaming services except from Netflix (and Netflix seems to work exactly as it should when it comes to this, 100% of the time), so I don't know if this is a usual thing. 

Just like Netflix, Disney+ has the feature that lets you keep watching an episode from where you left off. 
But Netflix, is ""smart"" enough to know when it should just get you to the next episode. (if you closed an episode during the credits, the next time you open the series, it'll just show you the next episode).

Disney+ doesn't do that. It will start the episode exactly where you left off, even if you shut it off during the credits. If they at least had a button that lets you skip to the next episode at any point, it wouldn't be as big of a deal. But they only have the little window at the end of the show that does that, and if you reopen an episode that you closed during the credits, that little window doesn't even appear. 
So you either have to watch all the credits or go back and scroll through the list of the episodes to get to the one you want. 

Does that bother anyone else, or am I just being weird?

Problem: Ever since the Star update, anything I watch now has foreign captions for any English text on screen. To clarify, it does not caption the audio, only captions text, which is a problem as sometimes it covers English subtitles that I need to see to understand certain scenes.

Steps taken: I have tried selecting ""Off"" in the caption settings several times to no avail, I have logged out and in several times, uninstalled the app, even gotten in contact with support to no avail. The account isn't set to any foreign country settings either. I can't possibly think of a reason for the issue.

"Sure, the current versions of the Star Wars movies, especially the early ones, are definitive enough already. But since they're the only versions available on Disney+, viewers seeing them for the first time would likely have no idea of all the changes that were made during the long history of the movies. Some changes such as the whole 'Greedo shot first' debacle are legendary enough already. But then there's others like the original Chimpanzee-eyed Emperor from the second movie that are unlikely to be seen again. It would therefore be an excellent service for posterity's sake if Lucasfilm can get their hands on previous versions of the changed scenes and make a neat special feature out of them.

* **Steps Taken**: Tried to adjust settings.

Has anyone encountered these 2 issues after the last 2 updates? An update came out and the next episode button disappeared, now to see the next episode of something I have to go back to the list and look for it because otherwise, it keeps playing the last 10 seconds of the end credits of the one I was watching before. When an episode ends, there's a ""skip credits"" button that doesn't always appear (nor work) and it's half ""out of the screen"" (I can only see part of it). I tried changing my settings thinking maybe the issue was with my screen ratio, but it's the right one and even if I change it the button is still in a weird position.

Then a new update was released and I hoped it would fix the issue but nothing changed, and now I have subtitles in the middle of the damn screen. For reference, I'm currently watching Bones - but it happens with everything, I tried.

Has any of you managed to fix this - if you encountered it?

"There is an amazing background picture of Mando that I saw after The Mandalorian S2E3 ""Chapter 11: The Heiress"" – in the transition screen that prompts you to see the next episode. I'm really interested in setting this as my desktop wallpaper. Here's what it looks like:

[Screenshot of the picture in question](https://preview.redd.it/0017sb5rw0l61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fed8a6a6d4cd3055865e00cbd92c01518a88546)

As you can see, the picture on-screen is obscured by some UI-elements of Disney+ (Edge browser on PC), so taking a screenshot wasn't really getting me anywhere. And I quickly discovered that you can't just save it down either. I tried everything I could; searching via the browser's web developer inspection tool and doing a reverse image search with 3 different sites. Nothing worked. It's also extra-difficult because that transition screen where the picture appears only lasts 10 seconds until the next episode is automatically played – and there is no way to pause it. I also contacted Disney+ support to ask if they could send it, but the support agent said that wouldn't be possible. Curious, that such a simple request couldn't be satisfied.

By any chance, is someone able to provide this image or an idea on how it's possible to save it down?

-Devices:

-TV: Sony X930D

-Streaming device: Firecube TV

-AVR: Yamaha RX-A3050

-Oppo 203 4K Disc Player

-Services: Disney+, Prime Video

-Country: USA

-Steps Taken: Playing around with all sound configurations and trying out different hardware for solution.

Ultimately it comes down to one or the other.  HDR picture over object based audio.

My tv is limited to compressed audio through it's arc return.  So the most I'll hear is compressed 5.1 dolby digital.  But I'll get HDR.

If I use my Firecube TV through my AVR, I achieve Dolby Atmos but HDR doesn't look as vibrant as natively steaming content from the TV OS itself.  This could be solved by updating to a TV with EARC return.  (Potentially up to a $2,500 upgrade). The same can be said about upgrading the receiver.  Because the receiver may require a EARC port as well.  (Potentially up to another $2,000)

I should note I tried my PS4 Pro playing God of War in HDR between the AvR and the TV directly and noticed the same dim appearance running HDR content through the AvR.  I did attempt a work around.  By running my PS4 into my Oppos HDMI in, then running the players HDMI out to the tv directly, I achieve full HDR with Atmos audio (when available) as a 2nd hdmi out is sent to the AvR. But this is a tedious process. I have to turn on the TV, the AvR, The Oppo, set input on the Oppo to hdmi in, then check the AvR audio is set to the Oppo and then I can finally get the full av experience my current equipment can handle.  I'm not even sure I can program a logetich smart remote to follow all those steps to simplify this experience.

My son is rewatching an animated series. Bc he's seen them before, instead of autoplay starting the next episode at the beginning, it starts at the end credits. So, this results in continuous autoplay from episode to episode of just end credits. 


My work around has been to click on an episode, let it load, back out, then where it says ""Resume S1 Ep 3"" or ""Restart"", I chose restart and it wipes out the previous view.


There has to be an easier way instead of manually doing this for every episode of a multi season show. *And we have sat through the credits until the countdown to the next episode so, it's not like we previously stopped the episodes at the credits, backed out, and chosen the next one.

"Been seeing more backlash for the $30 Raya price just like we saw for Mulan, and I've been thinking about this and I think there's a simple answer for it:

The idea should be for Disney to incentivize a continual subscription and dis-incentivize drop-in/drop-out subscriptions.

So how about this:

Every month you maintain your subscription, give customers a ""premier token"" or however you want to call it. After you accumulate 3 tokens, you can buy premier content like Raya or Mulan or whatever.

Existing customers get rewarded for maintaining a subscription. New customers get the incentive to stick around instead of binge WandaVision and drop.

And of course, if people really want to drop $30 on a movie instead of hitting the theater, you absolutely let them.

"This month saw the addition of The Muppet Show to Disney+. It was great to finally watch some of these episodes again (I had the Star Wars/Mark Hamill episode on VHS as a kid). Now after adding The Muppet Show, which other Muppet content should Disney add to the service next?

 Unfortunately, some stuff can't get added due to rights issues. Sony owns the rights to Muppets Take Manhattan, Muppets from Space, and Kermit's Swamp years. Still, there are a lot of TV series and specials that could get added. 

I personally would like to see Muppets Tonight get added. It was a conitnuation of The Muppet Show that basically had a TV format instead of a theatrical format. Similar to TMS, Muppets Tonight had guest stars. This show had Michelle Pfeiffer, Prince, Pierce Brosnan, Rick Moranis, and much more. It only lasted for two seasons but it would be great to see the series on Disney+ instead of YouTube bootlegs. Which Muppets productions have the best chance of being added next?",month saw addit muppet show great final watch episod star war mark hamil episod vh kid ad muppet show muppet content add servic next unfortun stuff get ad due right issu soni own right muppet take manhattan muppet space kermit swamp year still lot tv seri special could get ad person would like see muppet tonight get ad conitnu muppet show basic tv format instead theatric format similar tm muppet tonight guest star show michel pfeiffer princ pierc brosnan rick morani much last two season would great see seri instead youtub bootleg muppet product best chanc ad next,1

"I'm working with Disney to get episode order issues and aspect ratio issues fixed. But metadata issues are another  thing all together and any help compiling and reporting them would be appreciated. particularly since I have no ability to go through STAR's library due to living in America and I'm guessing it brought with it tons of issues.

&amp;#x200B;

**Release Dates:**

* New Girl  (2011) is listed as 1999!!!
* Disney Illuminations Fireworks is listed as 3000!!!

&amp;#x200B;

**Titles:**

* Roll it Back (Shorts) is mistitled Disney Roll it Back (Shorts)
* So Random (2011) is listed as Sonny With a Chance (Season 3) when it was actually a spin-off and separate show. All VOD sites have it properly listed as its own show.

&amp;#x200B;

**Misc:**

ANT Farm Season 1 episode titles do not have ANT capitalized in them - but seasons 2 and 3 do and the full series is formatted correctly on all VOD sites.

&amp;#x200B;

**Missing (Non-banned) Episodes: \[Not a metadata issue, but I'd love help reporting these\]**

* Little Mermaid episode (1x01 - Whale of a Tale)  is not banned or lost - it's available with the rest of the show on all digital VOD sites where the rest of the show can be purchased.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Replacements season 2 remains missing since launch. It is NOT banned or lost - it is available to purchase EVERYWHERE along with the 1st season.
* AFV Seasons 20-22 are missing.

"I have two boys, 9 and 12. When it was just Disney+, it was a safe space where the most “adult” content they had access to was Marvel and it was great. I didn’t need to worry. Now, with Star content, I have to choose to set their age level at PG in which case they lose practically all Marvel content, or the next level up in NZ is ‘M’ (Mature) but that includes things I definitely do not want them seeing like some of the adult animation shows. 

I know these threads always attract a backlash from people who want to comment on the OP’s parenting skills, but just know that my wife and I have a great relationship with our kids but I do want to protect them from accidentally watching the wrong kind of content. Some of those adult animation shows legitimately look like kids shows to the uninitiated and are in a completely different league to Black Panther or The Avengers even though they might fall into the same “M” rating.

"Hi all! 

I wanted to share my recent experience with Verizon to try to save someone else the hassle. 

I signed up with Verizon and got the free year of Disney+. Great! I planned to cancel after the free year and then eventually sign back up with Disney+ directly. 

My year was up in February. I received a reminder email from Verizon about the free subscription coming to an end on February 2 stating my promotion ends February 16. 

So, February 15 I try to cancel. No way to do it online, so I have to call. Ugh. I spend about 30 minutes on a call to get the Disney+ removed from my account (which included having to re-setup my auto pay and other annoying steps). 

Now, I receive my March Verizon bill and I see I am still billed for Disney+. I chat with a representative today and find out apparently my Verizon bill is generated on the 12th of each month, so even though I canceled my Disney+ before my free promotion ends, I have to pay for it for a month, but then it will be removed from my March bill (and going forward). 

I realize this is only a $7 charge, but it’s the principle of the matter. I tried to get the charge removed or a discount for the next bill, but Verizon refused. SO, instead, I’m coming here to warn other Verizon users of my experience to try to save someone else this frustration. 

TLDR: Cancel your free Disney+ promotion through Verizon BEFORE your billing date, regardless of when your “free” subscription ends.

"Hi, I’ve been using Disney Plus for a while now, and I really love it. I’ve shared my subscription and password with two of my friends so that they can use it too.

The problem is that they again share the password with their friends/“leaks” the password/logs in on their friends devices and forget to log out. Suddenly, a lot of people I don’t know, have access to my subscription.

I really wish Disney Plus would have the option to turn on two step verification, for two reasons:

1: Security

2: I could give my friends my password, but they would still need me to send the verification code each time they try to log in, which would give me a lot more control of how many devices they log in to, and how often.

————————————

The second thing I want to say, is that now that Star got introduced, I noticed Disney added the option to create passcode for each profile. (Which I think are great). The problem for me, is that the passcode can be seen/reset if you just type in the subscription password, which my friends got access to, meaning they can still access my profile, even though I create a passcode. (Of course, I understand that the passcode is meant for kids not getting access to their parents “18+”-profile, but I think it would be great to be able to keep other persons away from the profile too)

How I would like to see this improved, is for example receiving a confirm-mail, that you would have to confirm to be able to see/reset the passcode. An other way is using two step verification to see/reset it.

————————————

But if anyone knows any other smart ways to log in your friend with your Disney Plus subscription, without giving him the password, and without being in the same room, I would really appreciate you letting me know.

"All the PG-13 Star content is now accessible on the Disney+ app in Canada. No tile on the home screen yet and no integration into the Home Screen feed yet - I'm assuming that will happen after midnight when we get to mark our profiles as 'adult’ and can also access all the content rated 18+

UPDATE: The parental controls and 18+ content went live for me at 10.20pm. Hopefully it’s live for other Canadians now, too!

Couple of quick observations:

Looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the much hated HD upscale instead of a new transfer. Not a big surprise.

We have all episodes of Futurama - the four TV movies have been separated into episodes and listed as 'Season 6.'

There’s definitely some stuff here which wasn’t on the content lists released last month. For example, Bob’s Burgers wasn’t on the Canadian content list but we do have a couple of seasons.

* Steps Taken: I've checked all my language/subtitle options, they're all set appropriately. Used it on multiple devices to find the issues.

So the problem I'm having is, when I watch disney+ on my PS5, any on-screen text gets accompanied with a subtitle for another language, I'm not sure which one it is, but it looks like it's either german or danish.

It happens like, in the Simpsons, in S31E07 when  the whale talks, it has english text on screen normally that's baked in from the show, but then I also get the black bar subtitles translating it to another language at the top of the screen.

This issue doesn't happen on the PC when I watch the videos though.

I've also noticed that, on most shows, on PC or PS5, the end credits of the shows are in another language.

On top of that if you are watching from the continue watching screen it boots you out to the main menu at the end of the episode and cues up the episode you just watched. The option to skip credits is also missing and you have to wait through the foreign language credits also.

"I had honestly forgotten it existed. I remember watching the previews a while back and thinking to myself “this is a must watch, write it down so you don’t forget”.  

Of course I forgot to write it down all together. I had originally wanted to catch it in the actual theater, but you know. ANYWHO. Logged in last night to watch the latest WandaVision and there it was bold and beautiful. 

THE BOOK OF LIFE. 

Added it to my list immediately so I wouldn’t forget to watch it at some point this week. In between everything else I have going on. 

Today was a really bad day for me. Everything I did went horribly askew until I finally decided I was giving up for the day and was just gonna hide under my blankets and drink what’s left of my special whiskey. By this point I had forgotten I added the movie to my watch list all together. 

Went through all of my other apps looking for a show or movie to distract me for a bit. Completely forgetting I now have the Disney app. Couldn’t find anything. Felt defeated. Spent a good few minutes just staring at my tv and all the PlayStation stuff displayed on it (my ps4 is my gaming, my tv channels and my music box) anyway as I sat there zoning out like a zombie?

I got the notification ding. 

Looked up and saw that the Disney app was installing its update. WAIT!! THAT’S RIGHT! I’VE GOT THE DISNEY APP.!!! DUH!

I’m only 26 minutes into the movie and it’s GORGEOUS. It’s funny, it’s creative, it’s educational and I had to hit pause to post this here because I think anyone and everyone who is subscribed NEEDS to watch this movie. 

The style of animation is perfection. So far everything in the movie is perfection. Emotionally engaging, visually spectacular and just enough humor to keep the very very dark theme palatable. 

If you get a chance?

Watch this movie. The Book Of Life.

"Hey all, I’m having a strange and frustrating issue that started occurring yesterday out of nowhere and I’m wondering if anyone else has had the same/knows a fix.  My autoplay function stopped working altogether.

Steps Taken: Updated App, rebooted device, deleted/redownloaded App, adjusted device settings

My Disney+ app on PS4 updated on 2/18. Since the update my subtitles have gone missing. I tried turning them off and on again while streaming but to turn them off I had to select “off” twice, and it was unsuccessful. I have restarted the app, rebooted the PS4, deleted and redownloaded the app, and adjusted the accessibility options on the PS4 to display subtitles as specified by content. Nothing has worked. 

While watching a different title last night I was able to select the Español subtitles, which worked, but we can’t read Spanish so they were unhelpful. When I tried to switch to English, they became both English and Spanish and took up a large portion of the screen. I was able to get just the English subtitles to work only for that title, and they were in large black text boxes, not large semi-transparent like they had been before the update. 

We aren’t hard of hearing but we do have small children, and we find the subtitles helpful for myself and my wife after the kids go to bed and we have to volume low, and to help the kids learn to read - they are seeing the words and hearing them at the same time. My oldest has pointed out that there aren’t words on the screen and is asking me to get them back. Any explanation or assistance would be much appreciated.

"I’ve been wondering who Disney Plus is making content for. When it first came out, I remember hearing that it would be exclusively for children and families. That there would be no R rated or adult themed content. 

But they have had the Simpsons from the very beginning and the Simpsons is not really for kids. Marvel movies are usually PG-13 and not appropriate for all ages. 

The main thing that makes me wonder is The Right Stuff. This original series portrayed a lot of scantily clad women, men cheating on their wives, sex scenes (or moments leading up to sex, not simulated sex scenes), lots of drinking alcohol and general behavior that is unbecoming for the characters/not setting a good example for children. 

I have no problem with any of it. It was a good show. But definitely adult-themed. I just don’t understand why Disney would produce this show while simultaneously killing the Lizzie McGuire revival because it was too adult themed. 

The show was going to feature Lizzie going through a divorce because her husband cheated. I assume it would focus on her raising her kids while having a career and also dating and would probably show the impact divorce has on kids, while also being a funny family show. (By the way, is the script available to read online? I’d like to read it!)

I’m also aware that Disney chose to release Love, Victor and High Fidelity on Hulu because those shows didn’t fit their family-friendly model. I’ve only seen Love, Victor, but didn’t find it especially adult themed. It featured teen LGBTQ characters, so it definitely feels like Disney is saying LGBTQ characters are not family friendly. (I’m also aware of the gay character and modern family dynamics on Andi Mack so I know they’re somewhat okay with these themes.)

I just don’t understand how they decide what is and isn’t family family friendly. I don’t love the idea of Disney cornering the market on “family friendly” content when their values seem to differ widely from my values and the values I would want to share with my kids. 

To go back to The Right Stuff vs Lizzie McGuire, we could interpret it as Disney being willing to portray men having realistic lives while not wanting to portray women having realistic lives. Or that it’s okay to see husbands cheating from the men‘s perspective but not the wife’s perspective.

How can they justify the hypocrisy? Or is there no hypocrisy and I’m misinterpreting? Is Disney Plus supposed to be exclusively for kids and families or not? What ultimately is their business model?

I've been watching the MCU films and noticed that the Russian and Indian segments of Avengers don't show the translation subtitles, nor does Thor 2 show the subtitles for the Dark Elf dialogue.

They display correctly on the Android version of the app, just not on the PlayStation 5.

"As much as I like Star Wars and the MCU, I think that DisneyPlus will need big budget series that are not part of these two franchises, so here are three shows I would like to see in the future:

\- **A prequel show about the Incredibles**: I am actually surprised Disney hasn't announced this yet. A prequel show about Mr. Incredible and the good old days where he has to face different threats with Frozone and eventually meets his future wife Elastigirl.

\- **A Pirates of the Caribbean show**: Give this franchise the same treatment as Star Wars and focus on a TV show instead of more movies. If they could use the stagecraft technic for the water scenes they could keep the budget reasonable.

\- **A show about the Eragon books**: The books are far from perfect and they would have to adapt them carefully in order to make them work as a TV show but I would love to see a show that features dragons. In my opinion this will be the next logical step if Percy Jackson turns out to be a success.

"So I scrolled through a bit of this subreddit, and looked at some of the hot and new posts. Most of the posts seem to read like marketing material instead of actual human interactions. I'm not sure if it's because I haven't been on Reddit very much, or if this is more just exclusive to this subreddit's ecosystem.

Outside of the subreddit, the actual streaming service doesn't seem all that great to me. The UI is  clunky (not as bad as Amazon Prime, but that's a low bar), there's no reviews available on the app for any shows or movies to avoid wasting the viewers time and expectations, I mostly just get recommendations for the same Disney properties I've seen dozens of times already, and even with the lower price comparison to Netflix it just doesn't seem worth it. I think the only real reason I keep this subscription is just to watch the three new shows that interest me when they come out since almost all of Disney's 2020 movie releases were just bad.

I feel as though I'm paying $8 a month for 3 shows that release weekly for some reason, a bunch of older movies I've already seen, painfully childish cartoons that don't have any subtext in them to entertain anyone over the age of 12, the occasional documentary about nature or something, Jeff Goldblum who is a national treasure, and whatever their Disney+ exclusive movies were supposed to be. If Disney could just hurry up and incorporate all their acquisitions into one streaming platform with one overall cost, then it might actually be worthwhile. Even then, the Mandalorian season finale reveal of a CG mask on a stunt guy instead of just a recasting after the flak Disney got for doing it in a movie was surprising in a bad way. I also recognize that COVID really put the kibosh on their launch plans, but man, is it just painful. 

A good metaphor for Disney+ in my mind is like making a PowerPoint presentation that you think needs to be done by Friday, starting at a reasonable time to finish by Friday, finding out on Tuesday that it needs to be ready by Wednesday, scrambling to finish the presentation, filling the last half of the slideshow with MS Paint drawings, barely coherent points, and a few slides from a different presentation you gave 10 years ago to pad the numbers, and expecting to keep your job after making the presentation.

"anyone else find the UI and menus to be terrible? i thought it would improve over time but its honestly really bad. nothing is intuitive, the auto play takes a while to actually start, theres no menus to skip or select epsiodes within the playback window. the ""continue watching"" sometimes doesnt show movies or shows im watching but when i search from it again it does have the ""resume"" button.  nothing (on the desktop version at least) is fluid. everything feels stiff and chunky?  


it really makes it hard for passive viewing and is a big factor in why i wont just keep my subscription month to month (pay for a month when a few new shows/ movies come out - binge them then cancel for a while). whereas if it was easier to use i wouldnt mind spending the money so i could quickly pull up episodes or shows i like and watch in my spare time.

"Falcon &amp; Winter Soldier’s showrunner knows he had a huge opportunity, to discuss what it takes for a Black man to become Captain America.

Sam’s journey to become Captain America will be a big part of the series.

John Walker appears to take the mantle up before Sam does, but toys have confirmed Sam will become Captain America by the end.

It’s clear that part of the story will include discussions about race, especially if rumors of the first secret Black Captain America appearing are true.

This could allow Falcon &amp; Winter Soldier to surprise many viewers, and be much more than the buddy-cop show the trailers have teased.

"I'm new to this sub, and not sure if general discussion or analystic posts are generally accepted, but I had some free time today and decided to just browse the Disney+ app, the first time I've really been able to do so since launch day in 2019.

I'm going to put a huge disclaimer right here before I go any further: 

I am not saying that Pixar needs to only work on original media, including movies and shorts. I'm not saying that I don't want them to make sequels, or shorts based on previous Pixar films. I'm also not saying that every Pixar film series needs their own line of shorts. I'm not complaining about anything. This is just a fun and silly ""Holy cow, I didn't realize just how *much* Pixar cashed-in on the Cars brand.""

Here's the main post, and my random weekend discovery:

I know that Cars was huge at release. I didn't have small children in my household from 2006-Now, so I can't speak for Cars' popularity post-the movie's release in 2006, I just remember that in 2006, Cars was *the* kids movie (that adults could also enjoy, of course, all Pixar movies are.)

I was sitting here just flipping through ""Pixar Through the Years"" and from the very beginning with The Adventures of André &amp; Wally B. all the way up to the One Man Band short, every work released, aside from Toy Story 2, a sequel, and Mike's New Car, a short based on the previous Pixar film, Monsters Inc., is an original work.

Once you get to Cars, Lifted, an original short, is next, followed by Mater and the Ghost Light. I'm not going to list every single movie release and every single short release, but from 2006's ""Mater and the Ghostlight,"" and 2014's ""Cars Toon: The Radiator Springs 500 1/2"" (my God, what a name,) there are 32 total shorts, 16 total Cars shorts (12 of which being Mator-Focused) spanning 10 years. Out of these 32 total shorts, half of these are Cars shorts.

Cars shorts aren't the only ones that were made over those 10 years. Again, I won't list them all, but every movie post-Cars except The Good Dinosaur, Coco, Onward, and Soul recieved shorts in their series. Toy Story 4 is also getting up there to compete with Cars, with 11 shorts, all but one focusing on Forky.

This isn't how I imagined I'd spend one of my days off, but thanks to Disney by incorporating a ""By Release Date"" tab, I learned a lot from Pixar's history, including just how much they love Mater and Forky. I guess if I spent more time watching the Pixar movies I haven't seen rather than focusing so much on how many Cars shorts there are, I'd have more productive days.

I hope you all get as much of a laugh out of this as I did, I've typed and said ""short"" so much that I don't even remember what it means. Stay safe out there, and I hope everyone has a great weekend. Looking through ""Pixar Through the Years,"" it looks like Pixar went overboard with Cars shorts. And a disturbingly majority are Mater-focused.",new sub sure gener discuss analyst post gener accept free time today decid brows app first time realli abl sinc launch day go put huge disclaim right go say pixar need work origin media includ movi short say want make sequel short base previou pixar film also say everi pixar film seri need line short complain anyth fun silli holi cow realiz much pixar cash car brand main post random weekend discoveri know car huge releas small children household speak car popular post movi releas rememb car kid movi adult could also enjoy cours pixar movi sit flip pixar year begin adventur andr amp walli b way one man band short everi work releas asid toy stori sequel mike new car short base previou pixar film monster inc origin work get car lift origin short next follow mater ghost light go list everi singl movi releas everi singl short releas mater ghostlight car toon radiat spring god name total short total car short mator focus span year total short half car short car short one made year list everi movi post car except good dinosaur coco onward soul reciev short seri toy stori also get compet car short one focus forki imagin spend one day thank incorpor releas date tab learn lot pixar histori includ much love mater forki guess spent time watch pixar movi seen rather focus much mani car short product day hope get much laugh type said short much even rememb mean stay safe hope everyon great weekend look pixar year look like pixar went overboard car short disturbingli major mater focus,1

"While I welcome Disney's decision to return to a weekly release schedule for their shows compared to the full release model by competitors, I personally believe it could be improved.

9/10 times I prefer full season drops over weekly releases. Yet, I rarely have the time to watch more than a couple of hours at most per day. And even though I like watching the same show multiple days in a row I think there is something that was lost when weekly releases started to disappear (i.e. speculation, anticipation and discussion, but most importantly: spoiler free watching).

With Disney+ I'm in the dilemma: do I wait until the season is finished to watch it within a week, but run the risk of getting spoiled for close to every major event that occurs during the season, simply by using the internet; or do I watch 20-30 minute bits of the story each week for 2 months.

I think my problem with Disney+ Originals weekly release schedule is, their story develops to slow. These shows move at the speed of a sitcom, but try and convey the action and intricate story lines of interconnected blockbuster movies.

I believe that, even if they want to stretch out a season to cover multiple months (to rack in that monthly subscription), releasing two episodes a week (or the equivalent of close to an hour of content) would potentially improve the pace of the storytelling, which in turn would get more people to watch episodes around release.

\~50 min per episode = 1 per week (with 10+ episodes this could easily be 2 per week)

\~30 min per episode = 2 per week (ideal for 10 episode seasons aka Disney+ Originals?)

\~20 min per episode = 3 per week (especially with an episode count of 20+ per season)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Weekly episodes should be increased relative to their average runtime and total episode count of a season to improve the pace of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: After reading all the comments (Thank you), I realised I need to explain my point better: I'm not arguing for full releases.

I'm arguing for looking beyond the two options of either 1) a full release or 2) a single episode per week. Especially for shows that tell a continuous narrative throughout the season (Especially if the average runtime of an episode is ≤30 minutes). This could be by releasing 2 episodes a week.

If you disagree or you see another approach feel free to add it down below. Disney+ hasn't nailed weekly releases.

"Star TV was founded in 1990 in Asia by a few companies not important to the story but then Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation (through 21st Century Fox) bought all of Star TV by 1993. They started a subsidiary in India called 'Star India' which later became the parent company absorbing all the business under it.

In 2015, Star India started its own streaming service for sports and general entertainment called *Hotstar* with content from India and all over the world including shows from labels like HBO and Showtime under exclusive licensing deals. 

They acquired exclusive streaming rights for the Indian Premier League (Cricket tournament) in 2015 which actually made Hotstar a big deal in India along with the fact that it was the exclusive home of Game of Thrones. 

In 2019, Disney acquired 21st Century Fox, in the process it also acquired Star India which later became a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company India. 

In late 2019 Disney+ was launched but they didn't want to create unnecessary competition for themselves in the Indian market since Hotstar already existed and they owned it. So they rebranded the service to *Disney+ Hotstar* and made it the official home of Disney content in India. Disney+ Hotstar was also expanded to Indonesia minus the third party content from the likes of HBO and Showtime. 

Now coming to Star. As you have already seen where they have borrowed the name of the service from. Yes, from Star India. Star is not a separate streaming service, it will be available as the sixth tab on Disney+ (along with Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar etc.) and it will house all of the mature content available on Disney+. The Star service will available in every country that has Disney+ except in USA where Disney already runs Hulu. Since a lot of people have been asking the difference between Disney+, Star and Disney+ Hotstar, here's a definite explanation.

Hi  I have a very hard time getting group watch to work on my 2019 iPad. Me and the other person both have Disney plus accounts.  They send me the invite in messenger and when I open it it sends me to safari and asks me  to download the app which I already have! Sometimes I can forward the link to my spouse's android phone and there I can just click on ""open with Disney Plus"" and then it works.  I can't just open the link  with the Disney plus app on the ipad?

Please help as this is very frustrating! I have been trying t do this for 2 hours and when I called Disney Plus phone number the representative said that it does not work with the ipad but I did get it to work with that android workaround. Thank you.

I know Disney+ supports the cast feature so what is Netflix doing right that Disney isn't? Is anyone else having this weirdness ?

"Hi there!  We have been rewatching the Marvel movies with friends using Disney's Groupwatch... and there seems to be a new ""feature "" where the credits start rolling, and the viewing window diminishes to a postage stamp size,  so the background can show a promotional shot of the movie (still).  Also asks if you want to leave groupwatch.

Anyone found a way to resize the window back to normal so you can watch the end credit scenes?  Both our computer and Roku seem to do nothing to resolve it.

Thanks in advance for any advice...
